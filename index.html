            “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
            been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
            course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
            life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
          I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
          program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
          The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
          learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
          example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
          job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
